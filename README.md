# CP/M for the Commander X16
This is a work-in-progress port of CP/M to the Commander X16. It requires a Z80 expansion card in order to run. If anyone is intrested in creating one, please let me know.

# Build status
You can't build it yet. I am currenly working on the bootloader. I haven't ported a single line of CP/M's code.
